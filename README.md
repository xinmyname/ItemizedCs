# ItemizedCs

This is the C# version of Itemized. The program adds items to inventory and then prints out how many items you have. You can specify how many items to add by passing a number as an argument. If you don't specify any items, you will receive one item. 

Yes, it's very simple. That's the idea.

## Example

$> Itemize.exe

You have:
  An item

$> Itemize.exe 4

You have:
  Four items

$> Itemize.exe 42

You have: 
  42 items

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2017
- .NET Framework 4.6.1

## Notes

I'll move this .NET Core later, for now it just builds/runs in Windows.
